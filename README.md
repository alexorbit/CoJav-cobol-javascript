 # COBOL-JS Server Framework

A lightweight, modular JavaScript-based server framework designed to run COBOL programs. This server framework mimics the simplicity of Node.js but provides a custom environment for interpreting COBOL code within a JavaScript context.

## Features

- **Single-File Server**: The entire server logic is contained within a single JavaScript file.
- **COBOL Execution Capability**: Simulates or interprets COBOL commands in a JavaScript environment.
- **Lightweight and Modular**: Minimal dependencies and modular design make it easy to extend.
- **Compatible with Vercel**: Deployable as a serverless function on Vercel or other cloud platforms.
- **Easy to Run Locally**: Start the server with a single command.

## Requirements

- Node.js (version 14 or later)
- NPM (Node Package Manager)
