# COBOL API Starter

A boilerplate starter for a lightweight, modular JavaScript-based server framework that interprets COBOL code. This server framework simulates a Node.js environment and runs COBOL programs using a simple JavaScript-based interpreter.

## Features

- **Single-File Server**: The server logic is contained within a single JavaScript file.
- **COBOL Interpreter**: Simulates the execution of basic COBOL commands within a JavaScript environment.
- **Lightweight and Modular**: Minimal dependencies with a modular design for easy extension.
- **Compatible with Vercel**: Deployable as a serverless function on Vercel.
- **Easy to Run Locally**: Start the server with a single command.

## Requirements

- Node.js (version 14 or later)
- NPM (Node Package Manager)
